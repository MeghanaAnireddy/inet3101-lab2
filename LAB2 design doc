This code uses an in-memory database in C that allows users to store and manage records dynamically using memory allocation (`malloc()` and `free()`). The program does not use arrays or linked lists.

Add a new record: Stores a new part record in dynamically allocated memory.
Delete the last record: Removes the most recently added record and re-allocates memory.
Print all records: Displays all stored part records.
Print number of records: Shows the current number of stored records.
Print database size: Displays the total memory usage of the database.
Track modifications: Keeps count of how many times the database has been modified.
Memory Management: Dynamically manages memory without using `realloc()`.
